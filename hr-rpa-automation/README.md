# HR RPA Automation Project (Python, SAP)

## Overview
This project automates HR data processing into SAP using Python-based RPA.
It replaces repetitive monthly manual configuration tasks with an automated workflow,
improving efficiency and data accuracy.

## Business Problem
HR functional teams manually processed employee data for:
- New hires
- Employee data updates
- Employee resignations

This process caused:
- High manual workload
- Risk of human error
- Delays in SAP configuration
- Inconsistent data handling

## Objective

- Standardize HR data processing

## Solution
A Python RPA solution was developed to:
- Read employee data from structured Excel files
- Validate and transform input data
- Automatically execute SAP configuration steps
- Log processing results for audit and review

## Workflow
1. HR team prepares employee data in Excel
2. Python script validates and processes the data
3. RPA performs SAP configuration automatically
4. System generates logs for review

## Tools & Technologies
